**Hi! My name is Dan Major-Smith - Welcome!**

I originally trained as an Evolutionary Anthropologist, and for my PhD (awarded in 2017) I was fortunate enough to conduct fieldwork in the Philippines working with the Agta, one of the last remaining populations of hunter-gatherers. In-between lazing on the beach and napping in a hammock, my main interest was in evolutionary theories of cooperation, which I explored using various experimental games.

Since 2016, I have worked at the University of Bristol in the Population Health Sciences department; originally as a data wrangler/Data Pipeline Manager within the [ALSPAC](http://www.bristol.ac.uk/alspac/) project, and then increasingly in a research role. I am now predominantly a - somewhat accidental - Epidemiologist with interests in causal inference, methods for handling missing data, and combining my epidemiological and evolutionary/anthropological backgrounds.

I currently divide my time between a project exploring whether [religious/spiritual beliefs and behaviours](https://ahrp.blogs.bristol.ac.uk/) are associated with health and well-being in the ALSPAC cohort and another project examining associations between access to green space and child cardiometabolic outcomes using a structured life course approach.

**Areas of interest:** _Epidemiology - Cohort Studies - Causal Inference - - Religion - Cooperation - Behavioural Ecology - Cultural Evolution - Life-History Theory_
