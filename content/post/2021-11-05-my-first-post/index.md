This is my first post, just to try out posting to a website. This is my first time trying to create a website, so the results may be a bit shoddy! 

I built the website using the 'blogdown' package in R, following the amazing guides [here](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/) and [here](https://www.apreshill.com/blog/2020-12-new-year-new-blogdown/). The site uses the 'hugo-lithium' theme, partly because this is the default, and partly (well, predominantly) because I couldn't get the 'wowchemy/starter-academic' theme to work - Obviously I'm doing something wrong, but have no idea what!

Other than the theme issues, creating and editing the site has actually been relatively simple. Anyway, this is just a test post to make sure I know what I'm doing; next step is to link this to GitHub and make the website live on netlify - Wish me luck...!
